<h2>Top Five European Vacation Locations</h2>

            <input type="button" value="Favorite" class="11LocButton" id="favButton" onclick="changeFavButton(this)">
            <p>Paris is undoubtedly the beating heart of France, filled with highly regarded museums, monuments and churches. You could easily spend your entire vacation admiring iconic sights like the Eiffel Tower on a sightseeing tour, wandering through exhibits at the Louvre and strolling through the beautiful greenery at the Luxembourg Gardens. And you won't want to miss shopping along this European destination's famous thoroughfare, Champs-Élysées, which is lined with designer shops, theaters and more. Once the sun sets, sit down for a decadent French meal at one of the city's many Michelin-starred restaurants.</p>

            <img src="../Images/Swiss Alps.jpeg" alt="videoplaceholder" width="90" height="90">
            <input type="button" value="Favorite" class="12LocButton" id="favButton" onclick="changeFavButton(this)">
            <p>Located south of Zurich, Bern and Basel, the Swiss Alps are a haven for winter sports enthusiasts. While skiing, hiking and snowboarding tend to dominate this region, you'll also discover quaint towns, serene lakes and gorgeous scenery that can be experienced year-round. Luxury mountain resorts are available throughout the region as well, making it a playground for all sorts of travelers. Additionally, no trip to the Swiss Alps would be complete without indulging in some warm, gooey cheese fondue and melt-in-your-mouth Swiss chocolate.</p>

        <div class="leftcountry"> 
            <span>No.3</span>
            <img src="../Images/Rome.jpeg" alt="videoplaceholder" width="90" height="90">
            <input type="button" value="Favorite" class="13LocButton" id="favButton" onclick="changeFavButton(this)">
            <p>Rome is a can't-miss European city on any Italy itinerary. The aroma of fresh Italian cooking wafts through the alleys and stately historical sights stand proudly at every turn. No visit to Italy's capital would be complete without checking out the Colosseum, the Roman Forum and the intricate Trevi Fountain on an informative guided tour. Plus, nearby St. Peter's Basilica and the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City (famous for the great Renaissance artist Michelangelo's stunning frescos) are sure to impress. If you have additional time, venture beyond the main attractions to Trastevere and the Spanish Steps.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="rightcountry"> 
            <span>No.4</span>
            <img src="../Images/London.jpeg" alt="videoplaceholder" width="90" height="90">
            <input type="button" value="Favorite" class="14LocButton" id="favButton" onclick="changeFavButton(this)">
            <p>Exploring the world-famous British Museum, seeing a musical in the West End theater district, watching the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace and gorging on fish and chips at a local pub are all part of the London experience. History buffs can step back in time at the Tower of London, while foodies eat their way through the Borough Market. Because there are endless things to do in this U.K. metropolis, you'll want to book a sightseeing tour to optimize your time. However, London's high hotel prices can make travelers with tight budgets cringe. To save money, book your accommodations far in advance.</p>

        <div class="leftcountry"> 
            <span>No.5</span>
            <img src="../Images/Amsterdam.jpeg" alt="videoplaceholder" width="90" height="90">
            <input type="button" value="Favorite" class="15LocButton" id="favButton" onclick="changeFavButton(this)">
            <p>There's more to Amsterdam than its notorious "coffee shops" and Red Light District. Spend the day cycling through the city's stylish streets (this Netherlands locale is so bike-friendly, it has more bikes than it does residents) before exploring noteworthy museums like the Van Gogh Museum, the Dutch Resistance Museum and the Anne Frank House. Plan a picnic in Vondelpark for lunch or opt for a boat tour along the city's many canals when it's time to rest your feet. While you're here, consider planning a daytrip to one of Amsterdam's nearby gems – Utrecht, Zaanse Shans and the Keukenhof Gardens are all worth visiting.</p>
